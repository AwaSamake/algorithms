 * 2.4 Partition
 *     Write code to partition a linked list around a value x, such that all nodes less
 *     than x come before all nodes greater than or equal to x, if x is contained within
 *     the list, the values of x only need to be after the elements less that x(see below).
 *     The partition element x can appear anywhere in the "right partition"; It does not
 *     need to appear between the left and right partitions.
