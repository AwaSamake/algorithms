/**

 * 5.1 Insertion
 *     You are given two 32-bit numbers, N and M, and two bit positions, i and j. Write a
 *     method to inert M into N such that M starts at bit j and ends at bit i. You can
 *     assume that the bit j though i have enough space to fit all of M. That is, if
 *     M = 10011, you can assume that there are at least 5 bit between j and i. You would
 *     not, for example, have j = 3 and i = 2, because M could not fully fit between bit
 *     3 and bit 2.
 *     Example:
 *         Input:  N = 10000000000, M = 10011, j = 2, j =6
 *         Output: N = 10001001100
