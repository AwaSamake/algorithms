/**

 * 4.12 Paths with Sum
 *     You are given a binary tree in which each node contains an integer value (which
 *     might be positive or negative). Design an algorithm to count the number of oaths
 *     that sum to a given value. The path does not need to start or end at the root or
 *     leaf, but it must go downwards (traveling only from parent nodes to child nodes).
