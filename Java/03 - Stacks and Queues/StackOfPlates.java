/**
 *
 * 3.3 Stack of Plates
 *     Imagine a (literal) stack of plates. if the stack gets to high, it might tipple.
 *     Therefore, in real life, we would likely start a new stack when the previous stack
 *     exceeds some threshold. Implement a data structure SetOfStacks that mimics this.
 *     SetOfStacks should be composed fo several stacks and should create a new stack once
 *     the previous one exceeds capacity. SetOfStacks.push() and SetOfStacks.pop() should
 *     behave identically to a single stack (that is, pop() should return the same values
 *     as it would if there were just a single stack).
 *     FOLLOW UP
 *     Implement a function popAt(int index) which performs a pop operation on a specific
 *     sub-stack.
