/**
 *
 * 1.6 String Compression
 *     Implement a method to perform basic string compression using the counts of
 *     repeated characters. For example, the string aabcccccaaa would become a2b1c5a3.
 *     if the "compressed" string would not become smaller that the original string,
 *     your method should return the original string. You can assume the string has only
 *     uppercase and lowercase letter (a-z).
