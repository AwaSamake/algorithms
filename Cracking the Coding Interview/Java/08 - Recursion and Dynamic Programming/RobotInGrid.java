 * 8.2 Robot in a Grid
 *     Imagine a robot sitting on the upper left corner of grid with r rows and c columns.
 *     The robot can only move in two directions, right and down, but curtain cells are 
 *     "off limits" such that the robot cannot steps on them. Design an algorithm to find
 *     a path for the robot from the top left to the bottom right.
