/**
 *
 * 4.7 Build Order
 *     You are given a list of dependencies (which is a list of pair of projects, where
 *     the second project is dependent on the first project). All of a projects' dependencies
 *     must be build before the project is. Find a build order that will allow the projects
 *     to be build. If there is no valid build order, return an error.
 *     EXAMPLE
 *     Input:
 *         project: a, b, c, d, e, f
 *         dependencies: (a, d), (f, b), (b, d), (f, a), (d, c)
 *     Output: f, e, a, b, d, c
